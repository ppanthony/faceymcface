# FaceyMcFace

An OSINT tool for finding username avatars, based heavily on the previous work of [Sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock), it attempts to enumerate / scrape / exploit open APIs to return an array of images that may be utilised further in your research project.

Getting started
Pip install
Specify user in def main
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
python ./faceymcface.py

(I know, I know decent command line arguments incoming)
